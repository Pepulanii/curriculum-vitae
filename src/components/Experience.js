                  <strong>ZESCO IT Support</strong>

                <p>
                  Worked as IT Support (Internship) for ZESCO head office. Used
                  business information systems to resolve computer terminal
                  issues remotely. For instance I used vnc software to reinstall
                  software on another employees computer remotely. This was done
                  efficiently because I did not need to be at the employees
                  terminal physically. During my short tenure at Zesco, learned
                  to work with a team and as well as how to use information
                  system software to resolve computer issues within the
                  organization.
