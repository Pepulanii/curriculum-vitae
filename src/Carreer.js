            Worked as IT Support (Internship) for ZESCO head office. Used
            business information systems to resolve computer terminal issues
            remotely. For instance I used vnc software to reinstall software on
            another employees computer remotely. This was done efficiently
            because I did not need to be at the employees terminal physically.
            During my short tenure at Zesco, learned to work with a team and as
            well as how to use information system software to resolve computer
            issues within the organization.
